This project is about developing an Extended Kalman Filter for a robot, called Pioneer p3dx.
In the first step, the EKF has been successfully developed for the dynamic model of the system.
In the second step, the EKF should be connected to CoppeliaSim software and taking a test by running the simulation and the EKF concurrently.
